### Programs

You need [EasyEffects](https://github.com/wwmm/easyeffects) to load the equalizer settings file.

## Usage
### Load the profile 

You can load the profile including the Equalizer settings from the most up-to-date version under `/profiles`.

### Additional information

Some filters are intentionally deactivated:

- `Deesser` might come handy on poor audio recordings on voice
- `Filter` comes handy on poor audio recordings with microphone rumbing
- `Noise Reduction` might come handy on *very* poor recordings of voice, where you may want to blend out background noise.
